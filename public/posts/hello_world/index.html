<p>Well, this is it; I&rsquo;ve finally broken down, or perhaps just found the motivation, to start my personal blog. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been taking more time to reflect on my life, happiness, career, and just general philosophy and have been looking for a void into which I could post the more insightful or better thought out ones. Because I don&rsquo;t like the idea of picking up any social media habits (even the social blogging platforms seem like more trouble than value) and I&rsquo;m literally a software engineer by trade, having mostly worked on web services, I figure I have no excuse not to make use of my abilities and self publish my own blog.</p>
<p>This platform is not for any intended audience other than my future self and I am setting absolutely no expectations to regularly post. I do hope that this can eventually act as a replacement for the various unorganized and ephemeral legal pads I have historically used to organize my thoughts and perhaps it will even encourage me to think even harder before publishing.</p>
