      <description>Starting a personal blog Well, this is it; I&amp;rsquo;ve finally broken down, or perhaps just found the motivation, to start my personal blog. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking more time to reflect on my life, happiness, career, and just general philosophy and have been looking for a void into which I could post the more insightful or better thought out ones. Because I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of picking up any social media habits (even the social blogging platforms seem like more trouble than value) and I&amp;rsquo;m literally a software engineer by trade, having mostly worked on web services, I figure I have no excuse not to make use of my abilities and self publish my own blog.</description>
