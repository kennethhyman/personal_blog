## Starting a personal blog
Well, this is it; I've finally broken down, or perhaps just found the motivation, to start my personal blog. Recently, I've been taking more time to reflect on my life, happiness, career, and just general philosophy and have been looking for a void into which I could post the more insightful or better thought out ones. Because I don't like the idea of picking up any social media habits (even the social blogging platforms seem like more trouble than value) and I'm literally a software engineer by trade, having mostly worked on web services, I figure I have no excuse not to make use of my abilities and self publish my own blog.

This platform is not for any intended audience other than my future self and I am setting absolutely no expectations to regularly post. I do hope that this can eventually act as a replacement for the various unorganized and ephemeral legal pads I have historically used to organize my thoughts and perhaps it will even encourage me to think even harder before publishing.
